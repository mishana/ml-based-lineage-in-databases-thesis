\chapter{BFPDB Materialized Views}
\label{appendix:bfpdb_materiazlied_views}

Following is a detailed description of the materialized views (used in the experiments in section \ref{sec:advanced_experiments}) and the queries that created them.

\section{\texttt{prepared}}\label{appendix:sec:prepared}
Contains all the products-related information from the \texttt{products} table, for products that have a \textit{prepared} preparation state in the \texttt{serving\_size} table:
\input{figures/appendix_mvws_queries/prepared}

\section{\texttt{unprepared}}\label{appendix:sec:unprepared}
Contains all the products-related information from the \texttt{products} table, for products that have a \textit{unprepared} preparation state in the \texttt{serving\_size} table:
\input{figures/appendix_mvws_queries/unprepared}

\section{\texttt{readytodrink}}\label{appendix:sec:readytodrink}
Contains all the products-related information from the \texttt{products} table, for products that have a \textit{readytodrink} preparation state in the \texttt{serving\_size} table:
\input{figures/appendix_mvws_queries/readytodrink}


\section{\texttt{protein}}\label{appendix:sec:protein}
Contains all the products-related information from the \texttt{products} table, for products that have a \textit{protein} nutrient-related information in the \texttt{nutrients} table:
\input{figures/appendix_mvws_queries/protein}


\section{\texttt{sugars}}\label{appendix:sec:sugars}
Contains all the products-related information from the \texttt{products} table, for products that have a \textit{sugars} nutrient-related information in the \texttt{nutrients} table:
\input{figures/appendix_mvws_queries/sugars}


\section{\texttt{cholesterol}}\label{appendix:sec:cholesterol}
Contains all the products-related information from the \texttt{products} table, for products that have a \textit{cholesterol} nutrient-related information in the \texttt{nutrients} table:
\input{figures/appendix_mvws_queries/cholesterol}


\section{$\texttt{exp}\sb\texttt{1}$}\label{appendix:sec:exp1}
Contains distinct manufacturers of products that have \textit{sugar} as an ingredient, and contain \textit{protein} nutrient information. Also, these manufacturers produce \textit{prepared} products: 
\input{figures/appendix_mvws_queries/exp1}


\section{$\texttt{exp}\sb\texttt{2}$}\label{appendix:sec:exp2}
Contains distinct manufacturers of products that have \textit{water} as an ingredient, and contain \textit{protein} nutrient information. Also, these manufacturers produce \textit{unprepared} products: 
\input{figures/appendix_mvws_queries/exp2}


\section{$\texttt{exp}\sb\texttt{3}$}\label{appendix:sec:exp3}
Contains distinct manufacturers of products that have \textit{water} and \textit{sugar} as an ingredient, and contain \textit{protein} nutrient information. Also, these manufacturers produce \textit{prepared} and \textit{unprepared} products:
\input{figures/appendix_mvws_queries/exp3}


\section{$\texttt{exp}\sb\texttt{4}$}\label{appendix:sec:exp4}
Contains 10 distinct pairs of (product identifier, nutrient derivation code) for products that are produced by manufacturers from the $\texttt{exp}\sb\texttt{1}$ \textbf{or} $\texttt{exp}\sb\texttt{2}$ materialized views:
\input{figures/appendix_mvws_queries/exp4}
